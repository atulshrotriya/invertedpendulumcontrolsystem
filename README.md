# invertedpendulumcontrolsystem
A dynamic system featuring a hinged inverted pendulum over a cart which can be moved linearly in the same direction as the pendulum. Objective is to design a control system to keep the pendulum upright.
Software used for design - MATLAB and Simulink
Assumption is made for no energy losses, small angle approximations, masless rigid bar and point masses.
The system is to be designed for continuous and discrete inputs.
